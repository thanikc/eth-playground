Things you should understand are what a public and private key are, why a blockchain needs miners, how decentralized consensus is reached, what a transaction is, and the concepts of transaction scripting and smart contracts. Specifically for Ethereum you also should be familiar with what Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and gas are.
